Mu Duas Ma. Fnswsanu,

My copies ol your new History came to me last evening,
and I doubt not I shall derive much instruction and pleasure
from its perusal. However, Ι cannot help writing at once to
thank you for what, on cutting open some of its pagos, Ι find
you say ol myself. While the narrative preserves the sustained
tone proper to history, and is written with due dignity and gravity,
it is impossible not to discern in it a feeling of personal kindness ·
towards me—and Ι hope I may take it as a pledge that you do
not forget me and all ol us here in your good prayers, (as Ι assure
you Ι wish to remember you) that we may do our own work,
which God has given us, in our day and in our place.

I had already promised a copy of your volumes to a French
Priest, who is going to write some account ol religion in England,
and they shall go to him at once.

As I am writing, Ι am tempted to add, what I assure you is in
no sense the caasa of my writing, that there is just one point in
your chapter which requires a remark. It is a very minute one,
and relatas to just one half sentence. I think it was Mr. Oakeley's
view, that he might “ profess all Roman doctrine '' in the Ohuroh
of England, cr at least “hold it ”—and consequently that the 39
Anticles allowed ol it. Inever took this view. Iknew that they
bound me in various ways to oppose the Roman doctrines, and
my conscience approved ol this opposition-I mean, Ι thought ill
ol various tenets and principles of the Roman Ohurch. Accord-
ingly in 1841, alter No. 90, in a letter which the Bishop ol Oxford
required of me, Ι wrote with great violence against the doctrines
