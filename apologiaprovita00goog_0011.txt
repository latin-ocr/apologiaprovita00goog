may so say, not violently—I mean, Ι spoke what I internally fel
and what I was called by my Bishop to say, but what (from m
love of the Romen Ohurch) Ἰ would not have said then, (though
had said worse things in years past) unless it had been extorta
from me by what Ι held to be then competent authority-and
called it in that letter a “ confession,” as if Ι could not help sayin
it before such a tribunal. Ι recollect saying to Dr. Manning=
the time, “I can't help it-the Bishop aske me-I don't wis

Nc. 90 then was not a resolution of the 39 Articles into t.

Inever to this day have felt necessary to be dissutisfied wit

When at length Ι found my objections to the Roman Ore
